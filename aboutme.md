My name is Robert Row and I enjoy finding ways of extracting value from data. I have spent the past 4 years in marketing and economics split between a digital marketing agency, ethology, and the academic consultancy, the L. William Seidman Research Center.

I primarily use Python and R for my projects. But I have experience in web technologies for publishing data products. I am a marketer who enjoys using an economic lens to contextualize problems using data to inform strategy and tactics.
