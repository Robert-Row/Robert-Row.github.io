Impressions.

Our job as marketers is to deliver an impression. The impression is the vehicle through which we attempt to shape consumer perception of the brand. And not all impressions are received equally.

A network is a connected system of nodes and edges. A social network is a network where the nodes and edges represent features related to social connections, presumably human. These features encompass the available information to analyze and make decisions. 

Most of the time when people reference social networks they are referencing platforms such as Facebook. It's easy to think of marketing in terms of the tools available to you to deliver your impressions, but I think it's important to think about social networks as a representation of all human connection. 

Great, now that we have that overly dramatic piece out of the way... Let's talk specifically about Facebook. 

Facebook is a platform that has an absurd amount of features (Data) which comprises its social network. Your preferences, location, pictures, relationships & connections & interactions, and all of the data you willingly give creates quite a rich network. 

Your social purpose will largely approach how you treat this network. In the future I would like to define social purposes and treat them individually with strategy.
