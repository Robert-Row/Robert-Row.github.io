Impressions.

Our job as marketers is to deliver an impression. The impression is the vehicle through which we attempt to shape consumer perception of the brand. And not all impressions are received equally.

A network is a connected system of nodes and edges. A social network is a network where the nodes and edges represent features related to social connections, presumably human. These features encompass the available information to analyze and make decisions. 

Most of the time when social networks are referenced the conversation invariably takes Facebook into account. Similar to Search and Google. It's easy to think of marketing in terms of the tools available to you to deliver your impressions, but I think it's important to think about social networks as a representation of all human connection. Especially at the outside of creating a treatise or mental model to guide effort and strategy.
