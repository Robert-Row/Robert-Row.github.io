â€œA complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system."

JOHN GALL, SYSTEMS THEORIST


I want to extend the previous introductory post by incorporating the components of our social network mental model. This will contain the roadmap for defining any strategy for any industry. 

A Social Network:
	-An interconnected system of nodes & edges representing people & relationships. All characteristics and data associated with the network is contained within the nodes and edges of the network.

Social Network Marketing Strategy consists of three components:

1. Brand Management
2. Expansion
3. Acquisition

Treatment of the Social Network Marketing Strategy will inevitably rely on two concepts:

1. Length of Time in the Network
2. Sentiment of the Relationship
