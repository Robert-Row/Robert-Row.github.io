“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system."
JOHN GALL, SYSTEMS THEORIST


# A Social Network
  * An interconnected system of nodes & edges representing people & relationships. All characteristics and data associated with the network are contained within the nodes and edges (people & relationships) of the network.

I am going to unpack all of these terms in concepts so they make sense when developing strategy. I have heard many variations of the term, "content is king" within digital marketing. If this has mostly held true then I believe it stands to reason the sheer amount of content to compete with is staggering enough. I beleive social networks represent a new approach to marketing that embodies the general spirit of active engagement. Gone are the days of building a website and attracting people to convert. Social networks provide a data-rich framework to generate strategy and deliver the best impression to the right consumer at the right time.
